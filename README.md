This script is a hobby and as such may have some bugs or flaws, but it is intended to be a testbed for trying things that could be helpful for people trying to find parts.  Many functions are modular and can individually be disabled or enabled based on user preferences.    Inspiration for this userscript came from the now retired Digi-Key Sort By Price that added the then lacking title function to Digi-Key's website.

Requirements
This script is updated and tested on the most current official releases of Firefox and Greasemonkey (v25 and v1.12 respectively being the latest at last edit of this page).  It will most likely work with older versions of FF and GM, but those are not the targets.    The script is also compatible with Google Chrome with the help of the Tampermonkey extension although functions are less thoroughly checked and may break without notice. It is known to not work on versions of FF 11 and prior.
This script is not designed with small screens in mind.  A 900p or larger screen is recommended for the best experience.
